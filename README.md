# AI Note-Taking App

## Overview
Im Bekithemba ncube and my dessertation implementation.
AI Note-Taking App is an intelligent application designed to enhance productivity by leveraging state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to automatically transcribe spoken words, generate concise summaries, and extract key insights from unstructured data. The app is intended for both personal and enterprise use, enabling users to focus on critical tasks rather than manual note entry.

## Features

- **Voice Transcription:** Converts spoken language to text in real time.  
- **Text Summarization:** Automatically generates brief, accurate summaries of longer texts.    
- **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean, responsive dashboard that supports cross-platform usage (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
- **Scalability:** Designed to dynamically allocate resources using modern cloud-based and container orchestration techniques.  
- **Cost Efficiency:** Offers flexible deployment options (cloud, on-premises, low-budget) to optimize the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).
